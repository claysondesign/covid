As a regular visitor to the {{ supermarket name and location }}, it’s quite startling how staff are not wearing face coverings. Today, at {{ time }} there were around {{ Value }} members of staff on the shop floor, not one with a face covering.

I am aware of your policy and encouragement of staff to wear masks, {{ supermarket-covid-policy-link }} but in the current climate, the laid back approach of this store from either staff and/or management is quite something, bordering on reckless.

I’m aware that this is a wider problem in society with resistance to face coverings, but {{ supermarket name }} could and should step up and set a better example.

Throughout the past 6 months, this store has been a model of how to do things right re social distancing and service, so this is why this is disappointing.
